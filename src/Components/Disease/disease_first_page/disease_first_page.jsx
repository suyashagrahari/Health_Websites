            Migraine is a common neurological disease that causes a variety of
            symptoms, most notably a throbbing, pulsing headache on one side of
            your head. Your migraine will likely get worse with physical
            activity, lights, sounds or smells. It may last at least four hours
            or even days. About 12% of Americans have this genetic disorder.
            Research shows that itâ€™s the sixth most disabling disease in the
            world.
